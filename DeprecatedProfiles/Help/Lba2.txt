{h1 Fixes and improvements}
{f Gets the installer working on 64 bit systems}  
{f Solves an audio bug that mutes all sounds in the game}
{i Unfiltered or [gototab_...graphics_xBR xBRz] scaling}  
{i Better support for Xinput gamepads with screen relative analog movement, 
some bugs fixed and all buttons\axes correctly recognised by the game}

{b {f} ==[ Installing the game on a 64 bit system]== 
The game uses a 16 bit installer that doesn't work on 64 bit systems, to install 
the game on a 64 bit system, click a| InstallShield3 ^ here|a.  
}

{b {nfo} ==[ Supported versions]== 
I have developed this patch with the european version: b|Lba2.exe|b. The USA 
version, b|Twinsen.exe|b, might work, but the screen relative analog movement and 
the fixes for some controller bugs will be disabled }
 
{b {f} ==[Missing audio fix]== 
I have fixed a bug that causes the sound to disappears shortly afer you load a 
game. If my fix don't work for you, visit a|sndfix ^ this thread|a and 
download a replacement for the game's i|miles sound system dll|i: b|mss32.dll|b.
Version 5.0p is reported to work well with the game} 

{b {i} ==[Xinput gamepads]==  

{nfo b|Screen relative analog movement|b |n
To use the left stick for screen relative analog movement, you have to keep the 
keyboard i|up arrow|i key configured to move twinsen forward, which is the default}

{nfo b|Other commands|b |n

The remaining buttons\sticks\triggers\dpad must be configured in the game's 
i<configure keyboard>i menu. Everything will be recognised except the left stick.
The triggers which are normally recognised as up and down on the same axis, will
be recognised as buttons}

{f b|Bug fixes|b <ul>
l|The bug that causes the car to refuse to turn might still happen with the 
keyboard, but will most likely be fixed with the gamepad in the european version

l|The game sometimes "forgets" to check for gamepad input, the program fixes this 
bug  in the european version. In the USA version this can be fixed simply by entering
and leaving the i<configure keyboard>i menu} }
