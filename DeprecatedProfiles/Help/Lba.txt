{h1 Fixes and improvements} 
{i Unfiltered or [gototab_...graphics_xBR xBRz] scaling} 
{i A new save system that makes more sense}
{i Support for Xinput gamepads with screen relative analog movement}
{nfo b|Planed|b: Fix the non working individual volume controls}

{b {nfo} ==[ Supported versions]== 
Ment to be used with a|Lbawin ^ Lbawin version 0.8.1|a}

{b {i} ==[ [gototab_...graphics_xBR xBRz] scaling... ]==
...looks very good on this game, not only on the 
backgrounds, but also on the 3D models, so i can't recommend it enough }
 
{b {nfo} ==[If you enable [gototab_...graphics_xBR xBRz scaling] ]== 
You should also enable
the a|gototab_...graphics_SCLR ^ allow partial primary surface updates|a option, 
or the game might slow down on some parts depending on your computer specs}

{b {nfo} ==[New save system]==
To use the new save system, you first have to create a save named b|auto|b, or 
containing the word b|auto|b and make sure there will always be only one save 
file named likewise||n

From there on, the game will always update that file when it autosaves. You can 
create other saves with the i| copy savegame option|i and later, if you load that
save and continue to play, the game will update your progress in the 
i| b|auto|bsave|i file, not in the file you loaded>>n

Note: saves with names smaller then 4 characters will be ignored by the new
save system} 

{b {nfo} ==[Xinput gamepads]==
If you have a Xinput gamepad, it will work with the following layout: ||n

<table>
<tr><td> Confirm\Center screen  </td><td style='text-Align:right;'> A&nbsp               </td><td>  B&nbsp                </td><td>  Cancel\Pause menu </td></tr>
<tr><td> Interact\Talk          </td><td style='text-Align:right;'>  X&nbsp              </td><td>  Y&nbsp                </td><td>   Shoot magic ball </td></tr>
<tr><td> Behavior menu          </td><td style='text-Align:right;'> left Button&nbsp     </td><td>   right Button&nbsp    </td><td>   Behavior action  </td></tr>
<tr><td> Hollomap               </td><td style='text-Align:right;'>  left Trigger&nbsp   </td><td>  right Trigger&nbsp    </td><td>   Inventory        </td></tr>
<tr><td> Zoom                   </td><td style='text-Align:right;'>  back&nbsp           </td><td>  start&nbsp            </td><td>  Options           </td></tr>  																	
</table> |n

Use the dpad to navigate menus and move twinsen||n

Use the left analog stick for screen relative movement with 1024 possible angles||n 

Note: while Lbawin by itself supports screen relative movement, it only allows
eight different angles, making it hard to aim and even navigate in some screens}

{b {nfo} ==[Looping CD music]== 
If yo have trouble with the CD music, check the 
a|gototab_sound_WNMM.mci ^ MCI emulation|a option. You can also have looping CD music 
on a|pex_old ^ version 6 and earlier|a of this program ||n
In the future, I also plan on fixing the non working volume controls}
