{b {f} ==[Patching your game]==
{nfo Before you can play, there are other patches you'll need that can be download 
from a|patch ^ here|a}

{nfo You will need to install at least the i|d3drm.dll|i file
and the i|generic fixer|i}

{nfo The official patches released by creative reality (included in the link 
above) are optional}

{nfo You have to install the generic fixer after 
installing the official patches and you will have to run those installers
with admin privileges if your game is installed in a protected folder like 
Program Files(x86)}

{nfo Also note that peixoto's patch was not tested with the official 2.0 patch, only with
the unpatched game and with the 3.0 patch}}  

{b {f} ==[Gamma calibration fix]==
This fix will cause the gamma level set by the game to affect the entire desktop
so if the game crashes at anytime, you might need to 
a|gammatool ^ reset your desktop gamma |a}
