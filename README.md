## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Windows:**
* Windows 7 or later
* DirectX Runtime
* Visual C++ Redistributables

**Linux:**
* Wine 5.0+
* MinGW-w64 cross-compiler (for building)

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Daniel-Lobo/WineHooks/releases)
2. Extract to your desired location
3. Run `Injector.exe` (Windows) or `Injector.ahk` via AutoHotkey

### Quick Start

1. **Launch the GUI** - Run `Injector.exe`
2. **Select Your Game** - Find your game in the left panel
3. **Configure Options** - Adjust graphics, sound, and input settings
4. **Locate Game** - Click "Start" and browse to your game's executable
5. **Play** - The patch will inject and launch your game

### Creating Shortcuts

Use the "Create Shortcut" button to create desktop shortcuts that automatically launch games with WineHooks applied.

## üîß Building from Source

### Windows Build

```bash
cd dlls
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain-mingw.cmake
make
```

### Linux Build

```bash
cd dlls
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/usr/share/mingw/toolchain-mingw32.cmake
make
```

The build system generates:
* `peixoto.dll` (32-bit)
* `peixoto64.dll` (64-bit)

Both DLLs are placed in the `/Ahk` directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Each game profile is an `.ini` file with sections for:

### Basic Settings
```ini
Target=path\to\game.exe       # Game executable
D3D=9                         # DirectX version (6-12)
HD=true                       # Enable forced resolution
SSAA=2                        # Super sampling level
xBR=false                     # xBRz pixel art scaling
SYNC=true                     # VSync/triple buffering
```

### Advanced Options
```ini
WSTL=0                        # Texture swapping level
MHKS=true                     # Mouse hooks
Path=Game\Subfolder           # Relative path
singlecore=false              # Force single CPU core
HDPI=true                     # High DPI aware
```

### Input Mapping
```ini
[J2K]                         # Joystick to Keyboard
a=W,A,S,D,Space               # Map buttons to keys
deadzone=0.25                 # Analog stick deadzone
```

## üñºÔ∏è Texture Swapping

WineHooks supports runtime texture replacement for all supported games:

### Workflow
1. Enable "Show/Hide Thumbnail" hotkey in game settings
2. Launch game and press the hotkey to browse loaded textures
3. Use "Next/Previous" hotkeys to find the texture to replace
4. Press "Dump Texture" to save it to the `dumps/` folder
5. Edit the texture (maintain format: DDS, PNG, etc.)
6. Place replacement in `replacements/` folder with same name
7. Restart game - replacement is automatically loaded

### Supported Formats
* **DirectX**: DDS, BMP, PNG (auto-converted)
* **OpenGL**: PNG, TGA, BMP
* **Maximum Size**: Up to 4096x4096 (hardware dependent)

---

## üêß Linux/Wine Usage

### Running on Linux

```bash
# Install Wine and dependencies
sudo apt install wine winetricks mingw-w64

# Run WineHooks
wine Ahk/Injector.exe
```

### Wine Configuration
* Enable DXVK for DX10+ games via profile settings
* Use Wine's D3D for DX9 and earlier (better compatibility)
* Configure via `winecfg` for system-wide Wine settings

### Known Linux Issues
* Some games require specific Wine versions
* DXVK compatibility varies by game (see individual profiles)
* Native DirectDraw games work better with Wine's implementation

---

## üîå CheatEngine Integration

Many games include built-in trainers:

### Usage
1. Enable CheatEngine support in game profile
2. Launch game through WineHooks
3. Use hotkeys defined in `.CT.ahk` files

### Example Hotkeys
* `H` - Infinite Health
* `K` - Easy Kills
* `E` - Infinite Energy
* `L` - Max Resources

*See individual `.CT.ahk` files in `/CheatTables` for game-specific trainers*

---

## üìö Documentation

Detailed help files are available in the `/Help` directory:

* **Home.txt** - Getting started guide
* **DX8.txt, DX9.txt, etc.** - DirectX-specific options
* **Gl.txt** - OpenGL configuration
* **Sound.txt** - Audio settings
* **Input.txt** - Controller/keyboard mapping
* **Game-specific** - Individual game guides

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### DirectX 9
* Some games have shadow glitches with DXVK
* Frame limitation not yet implemented
* Reset() not fully implemented for HD mode

### DirectX 8
* Soul Reaver 2 occasional crashes
* Max Payne 2 intro movie resolution detection

### DirectX 7 and Earlier
* xBRz is CPU-only (performance impact)
* Some games have slow transparency rendering
* Execute buffer bugs with Wine (specific games)

### OpenGL
* Rune portal rendering issues
* Some texture upload hooks cause crashes

*See `/Ahk/Todo.txt` for complete issue list*
