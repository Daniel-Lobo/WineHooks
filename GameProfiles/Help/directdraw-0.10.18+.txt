::parent::Textswap.A8Fix_details::  
::HIDDEN::Textswap.A8Fix_detailed::Details::  
{b 
  The correct rendering of fonts on Blade of darkness depends on alpha 
  textures returning 1.0 for the color channels when sampled on the pixel stage. 
  With the introduction of the programable pipeline, the default value of 
  the color channels in alpha only textures on the pixel shader was changed to 
  [D3DFMT_A8 0.0]:
  On windows vista - and latter, the  Direct3D runtimes implement the fixed 
  function pipeline with [vista_shaders shaders]. What  
  I'm guessing happened here was that, at that point, the MS programers did not correctly
  replicated the fixed function alpha textures behavior on the pixel shaders 
  emulating the fixed function pipeline.   
  This fix is applied by replacing alpha only textures with full RGBA textures 
  with the color channels set to 255

::HIDDEN::Textswap.a_detailed::Details::
{b 
    Without pixel shaders or render to texture - which was supported by Direct3D
    since Direct3D 2, but not by most cards of the time - DirectX 7 and
    earlier games often employ the CPU to generate new unique textures every 
    frame to render dynamic effects such as shadow and light maps or water ripples. 
    Auto dump is impractical in such games generating an enormous 
    amount of dumps and making them unplayable. An option to dump all 
    textures at once will be added in the future to handle such games
