<b>Finding a game's DirectX version</b><br><br>

The surest way to determine the DirectX version is to create an entry with only 
the texture swap option enabled, if you can see the thumbnails after activating
the search, the DirectX verion you choosed is correct<br><br>

A good initial guess is the version of the DirectX installer the game comes with,
but most of the time, games will use one version earlier then the installer
version, and since there was never a DirectX 4, many games that bring the DirectX 
5 installer, are actually DirectX 3<br><br>

Most pure DirectDraw 2D games or games with a 3D software renderer will work with
either DirectX 3 or DirectX 5 selected
