Title::Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 and Soul Reaver 2::
{h1 Fixes and improvements} 
{f a<gototab_graphics_sxty -- Force 60 Hertz>a +  
a<gototab_graphics_sync -- forced vsync>a solves some crashes in both games}
{f Blood omen 2 also has a<gototab_cpu_singlecore -- singe core affinity>a set 
for extra stability, SR2 has a<gototab_graphics_sngl -- singe core Direct3D 8>a 
set instead, because a<gototab_cpu_singlecore -- singe core affinity>a causes
audio artifacts}
{i a<gototab_graphics_HD -- Forced resolution>a is also set for both games and
while not absolutely necessary, allows 
a<gototab_graphics_SSAA -- super sampling anti aliasing>a and prevents display 
mode changes for FMV playback on SR2} 
{i %XInput% }

{b {nfo} ==[Crashes]==
With the included fixes, you can play Blood Omen 2 start to finish without a s
single crash. In Soul Reaver 2 you will most likely still experience a few -
unless you can enable [gototab_CPU_Singlecore singe core affinity] without it 
causing sound glitches. If you have to replay a section because the came crashed,
use the cheats provided} 

{b {nfo} ==[Supported versions\widescreen]==
I use version 1.02 for both games. The BO2 patch can be downloaded
a<patch -- here>a, or patched for widescreen [bo2wide here]. For SR2, 
you also need a no-cd patch, so look arround. A widescreen patch for
SR2 can be found [sr2wide here]. The GOG versions for both games
is 1.02, i belive} 

{b {f} ==[Full screen effects bug]==
<ul>
l|You can hold shift when you start the games with this program to run their 
respective setups   
l|Run the SR2 setup to enable fullscreen (blur) effects
l|The blur is used to 
good effect in this game, nothing like other crystal dynamics games 
- TR legend, project snowblind - on which they just blur everything all the time,
but it has a b<BUG>b    
l| If you leave for the main menu when 
the blur is active - underwater for example - it gets permanently active, until
you trigger a situation that deactivates it, like emerging from underwater 
</ul> }
