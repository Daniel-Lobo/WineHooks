This can be used to get CD audio working correctly, but after enabling it will 
have to use a|WMP ^ windows media player|a to rip the CD audio tracks. It's a
very simple procedure, but pay attention to the following:||n 
<ul>l|Rip tracks in the wav format. It's the only format supported, files will 
be big, but will maintain CD	quality</li>
l| By default  a|WMP ^ winddows media player|a will name ripped tracks as:|n 
01 Track 1.wav, 02 Track 2.wav... 12 Track 12.wav... and so on</li>
Keep that naming convention or, if necessary, rename files acordinglly then paste all files in
the game's directory</ul>|n

positional sound. Positional sound 
is very basic at the moment, distance attenuation, sound cones
and a simple left and right panning. EAX's reverb sounds good, with good mufleling too|n::
