::Section::Texture swapping::
Textures swapping is a feature that allows the replacement of the textures in 
a game with new textures that have no restrictions in size other then the
maximum size supported by the video card - at least 4096x4096 in Direc3D9
shader model 3.0 and newer cards. In all supported games, even those whose 
engines only support 16 bit 256x256 textures - as it happens is most early 
Direct3D games - it is possible to swap the original textures with high
resolution textures||n

This feature is refered to as i|texture swapping|i because the original textures 
within the game's files are never modified. The patches just tell Direct3D - or
OpenGl- to use a replacement texture, instead or the original, for rendering.
On the next few paragraphs you will find a tutorial on how to use this feature 
that applies to all games supported||n

Swapping a texture requires you to dump that texture to disk while the game is
running and then paste the image you want to use as the replacement in the right
location. Before following this tutorial, you should click the game you want to 
modify in the list on the left and inspect how the texture swapping options are 
configured. This configuration is individual for each game. The 
i|texture swapping|i options are the following:||n

<pre>
Show\Hide Thumbnail - A hotkey that show or hides a thumbnail in the top left 
                      corner of the screen with one of the textures currently 
                      loaded, you will use this to search for the texture you
                      want to dump. Hold this when you start the game to have
                      search activated at start
Change text color   - A hotkey that changes the color of the text shown bellow 
                      the thumbnail, which informs how many textures are loaded, 
                      which is being showed in the thumbnail and which API the
                      games uses
Next                - A hotkey to select the next texture
Previous            - A hotkey to select the previous texture
Fast Browsing       - A hotkey to hold together with the Next or Previous 
                      hotkeys to browse textures  more quickly 
Dump Texture        - A hotkey to dump the current texture to disk 
Path                - A directory there will contain two folders. The i|dumps|i 
                      folder, which is where the patch will dump textures to,
                      and the i|replacements|i folder, where the replacements
                      should be placed
</pre>

b|Dumping textures|b ||n

l|Start the game then press the b|Show\Hide Thumbnail|b hotkey
during gameplay. Now you will see a thumbnail (whose size can be customized in 
the i|texture swapping|i options) in the top left corner of the screen with one 
of the textures currently loaded. The texture in the thumbnail is also disabled 
in the game, except on DirectX 3 and earlier||n

l|Use the b| Next|b and b|Previous|b hotkeys to browse all currently loaded 
textures (hold the b|Fast Browsing|b hotkey to browse them more quickly). 
When you find a texture you want to modify, press the b|Dump Texture |b hotkey
to dump that texture to disk||n

l|Textures will be dumped to a folder called b|Dumps|b in the path specified in
b|Path|b option. e.g.: if the path is|n i|"c:\some folder\some game"|i, the textures 
will be dumped to i|"c:\some folder\some game\dumps"|i. That folder is always 
automatically created by the program ||n

l|Textures will be dumped in the .dds format and named dump0.dds, dump1.dds and 
so on. You should not modify texture dumps, but you can rename them if you like ||n

b| Installing the replacement texture|b ||n

To finally replace a texture, all you have to do is to place a replacement 
image with the right format and name in the right location||n

In the example above, the b|path|b option was configured as 
i|"c:\some folder\some game"|i, so the replacements should be installed in
i|"c:\some folder\some game\replacements"|i||n 

A replacement file replaces a dump with the same name as it, so if you dumped a 
texture and renamed it to i|somename.dds|i, the replacement should also be called 
i|somename.dds|i, but it should be installed in the replacements folder, while the 
dump must remain in the dumps folder||n

b|Format of the replacement texture|b ||n
Replacement textures must also be in the .dds file format. The recommended 
pixel format for all games is DXT5, but remember that textures in compressed DXTn 
formats must have sizes that are integer multiples of 4. Even if some programs
can create DXTn files with different sizes, those won't be loaded||n 

To get arround this limitation or if you want the best possible quality,
use the A8R8G8B8 format for Direct3D games and A8B8G8R8 for OpenGl||n 

If you want small files, use the DXT1 format, but note that this format doesn't 
support partial transparency||n

On Direct3D 7 and earlier, you will frequently find textures with transparency, 
but no alpha channel. These textures use a|ckey ^ chroma keying|a. For these
textures, create replacements preferably in the X8R8G8B8 format - R5G6B5 and
X1R5G5B5 will also work. The replacement texture will inherit the color key of 
the original texture||n

Mipmaps are supported in all formats but note that mipmapped textures on DirectX 7
and earlier must have power of two dimensions||n

b|Distributing textures|b||n

If you want to distribute textures you have created, you can use use the 
b|texture compiler|b program - which can be found on the top of the games list
to the left - to merge all texture dumps into a single file, dump._dds. 
You can distribute only dump._dds without need to distribute the original dumps.
The replacements, obviously, must be distributed||n

::Section::Pixel shader swapping::
Pixel shader swapping is a feature that allows pixel shaders to be modified. 
So far, Direct3D 8 and 9 are supported and new shaders can be written either in 
Direct3D's shader assembly or high level shading (shader model 3.0) languages||n

Modifying a pixel shader requires you to dump the pixel shader compiled bytecode
to disk while the game is running and then paste the new shader code you want to
use as the replacement for the shader in the right location. Before following 
this tutorial, you should click the game you want to 
modify in the list on the left and to get to know and configure the pixel shader
swapping options. This configuration is individual for each game and its options  
are as follows:||n

<pre>
Enable\Disable search - Hotkey to start\stop browsing shaders 
Change text color   - A hotkey that changes the color of the text shown on
                      on screen when shader searching is enabled with 
                      information about the current selected shader
Next                - A hotkey to select the next shader
Previous            - A hotkey to select the previous shader
Fast Browsing       - A hotkey to hold together with the Next or Previous 
                      hotkeys to browse shaders more quickly 
Change Shader       - A hotkey the changes the mode how the current selected 
                      shader is temporally modified for easy identification
Dump Shader         - A hotkey to dump the current shader to disk 

</pre>

b|Dumping shaders|b ||n

l|Start the game then press the b|Enable\Disable search|b hotkey
during gameplay. Now you will see the assembly code of a shader on the 
screen or the text: "No pixel shaders" (most Direct3D8 games actually don't use 
shaders)||n

l|Use the b| Next|b and b|Previous|b hotkeys to browse all currently loaded 
shaders (hold the b|Fast Browsing|b hotkey to browse them more quickly). The
shader whose code is currently being shown is replaced by a simple shader that
either shows only the texture or vertex color. The b|Change Shader|b hotkey 
toggles between these two modes. When you find a shader you want to modify, 
press the b|Dump shader |b hotkey to dump that texture to disk||n

l|Shaders will be dumped to a folder called b|pixelshaders|b in the path you 
specified when added the game to the games list. If the game was already 
included, you can view the path in the error.log file. Two files will
be dumped: a binary file (.bin) and a text file (.txt). These files will be named
dump0.bin\dump0.txt, dump1.bin\dump1.txt and so on||n

b|Replacing shaders|b ||n

l|The next time you start the game, any dump.bin file with a corresponding 
dump.txt gets replaced with the shader on the dump.txt file. Initially, that file
contains the original code from the shader, but can be modified at will using 
shader asm ||n

l|Another method for modifying a shader contained in a dump.bin file is to create
a dump.hlsl file with hlsl - SM 3.0 code||n
