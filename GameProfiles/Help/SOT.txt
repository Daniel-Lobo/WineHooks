{f Gets fog working correctly}
{i Disables a postprocess blur shader that the game employs}
{i [gototab_graphics_HD Forced resolution] while not absolutely
necessary, allows a<gototab_graphics_SSAA -- super sampling anti aliasing>a}
{i %Xinput%}
{i %TexturesC%}

{b {f} ==[Fog fix]==
The fog fix is simply an ini edit, as described [fog here] }

{b {nfo} ==[Blur fix]==
Don't disable the a|gototab_graphics_PixelSwap ^ pixel shader swapping|a option 
or the post-fx blur won't be removed}
