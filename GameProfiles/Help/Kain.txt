[sound This] mod enhances the audio quality using the audio assets from the

{b {i} ==[PS1 quality FMVs]==

[video This] mod replaces the FMVs with the ones from the PS1, but on my 
system, i can't get it to run following the instructions in the read.me file, so
i implemented my own player for the improved FMVs. Here's how to use it||n
{nfo Download the [video FMVs mod] and install only the -[.bik]- files and nothing 
else} 
{nfo Download [vlc these vlc binaries] and extract 
the -[vlc]- folder to -[peixoto\program]- }
{nfo Enable [gototab_...graphics_NEFS non-exclusive fullscreen]}
}
