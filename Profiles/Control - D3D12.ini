created by others - see the pcgamingwiki link - and integrated here}
{i [gototab_graphics_HD FidelityFx super resolution] upscaling}
{b {f} ==[FidelityFx super resolution]== 
In orther for it to have effect, both the display and render resolution on the 
game's display menu must be set as the same value as the one set in the 
[gototab_graphics_RLMT limit resolutions] option. If the game doesn't let you 
change one of those values, change between fullscreen and borderless until it does}
{b
    ==[Disabling temporal anti aliasing]==
    This is implemented as a cheat, and applied automatically as long as cheat 
    engine is running. Peixoto's patch takes care of attaching cheat engine to 
    the game and enabling the cheat, but you have to start  cheat engine from
    the cheats button on the top of this page
