DX9
- Lorrds of shadow 1 and 2: glitches with DXVK, not working with wine
- Tomb Raider Legend, Aniversary, Underworld: not working with DXVK
- 64 bit (Conscript)
- Restore wait vblank as alternative to vsync (Portal jerky movement)
- Implement frame limitation
- wfog fix ?? (pop sot ??)
- clip planes fix (far cry)
- Implement IDirect3DDevice9::Reset when HD is enabled 
- Never Alone - Noise on shadows if Forced resolution is enabled
- Halo 1 - Forced resolution breaks shadows, bad detection of transformed 
  vertices (X)? state blocks related ?

DX8:
- Soul Reaver 2 always crashes at some point between Usctenheim and the airforge
  (most of the time on the cutscene with kain)
- Max Payne 2: intro movie knows the resolution and D3D8_HOOKS_DATA.scale is 0 

DX7-:
- xBRz has only CPU implementation, after migration to wine
- Star Trek Deep Space Nine - The Fallen. Implement fov correction without 
  zooming the UI. Use the current widescreen fix to find the FOV value and 
  search it with CE
- Fix slow bliting on managed surfaces. Slow 
  transparency on MGS
- Die by the sword: replacement textures not loaded              
- Soul reaver (wrace patch): screen not cleared after fmvs
- Die by the sword, fix slow menus (not related to ddraw) and Direct3D mode -
  requires win98 compatibility - not working (worst on wine)
- Fix pop3d save screen 
- Drakan - Slow when dragon fires. SSAA broken on MS ddraw. Slow with wine on windows
- Silver: glitches on fast travel and telescope  
- Outlaws: crashes from time to time accessing the menu
- Speterra core: broken
- Zanzahah: bad shadows with wine
- Dark vengeance, Forsaken: execute buffer bug with wine. FIX with Call setexecutedata with right data after unlock
- Outwars: On Linux FMVs are not scaled, (wine re-scaling to the size of the window the game overlays on the ddraw window to play FMVs ?). 
On windows, the overlay window hides the FMSs
- POP 3D: FMVs not showing on Linux and not scaled on windows. Seems to use ddraw locks with wine
LAYER
