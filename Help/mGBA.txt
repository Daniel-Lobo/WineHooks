::Title::[_mGBA mGBA] - Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance emulator::
{h1 Fixes and improvements} 
{i Allows [_xBR xBRz] upscaling, which is a little bit better then the 
[_xBR xBR] shader
supported by mGBA. [_xBR xBRz] implementation <strike> shamefully copied 
</strike> adapted from [libreto_xbrz here] }
{f [gototab_input_j2k.u Keyboard emulation with a Xinput Gamepad] details bellow}
{b
    {nfo} ==[Mode toggle]==
    You can use -[Q]- key to cicle through three different modes ||n
    <ul>
    l| [_xBR xBRz] disabled. Aspect ratio controled by mGBA
    l| [_xBR xBRz] enabled. Game Boy Advance aspect ratio
    l| [_xBR xBRz] enabled. Game Color aspect ratio
    </ul>
}
{b
     {nfo} ==[[gototab_input_j2k.u Keyboard emulation with a Xinput Gamepad]]==
     {nfo This is usefull to configure shortcuts to save\load states
     since, although mGBA supports shortcuts on the gamepad, it constantly crashes 
     when you try to access the save\load menus with the gamepad} 
     {nfo [gototab_input_j2k.u A profile] is already configured, but disabled. 
     If you choose to enable it, don't forget 
     to clear all mBGA's gamepad biddings - including shortcuts} 
}
{b
     {f} ==[mGBA crashes when you try to start a game]==
     This happens sometimes and I don't understand why yet, but it can be fixed 
     by deleting the -[portable.ini]- and -[QT.ini]- files in mGBA's folder.
     Note that mGBA also must be configured for OpenGL output 
}
{b
     {f} ==[Horizontal lines on windows mode]==
     Adjust the window to a wider aspect ratio
