{b {f} ==[Installing Tomb Raider 2 on a 64 bit system]==
If you have the CD version of tomb raider II and a 64 bit 
system, click a| InstallShield5 ^ here|a to install it}

{b {nfo} ==[Supported versions]==
{nfo Tomb Raider II and III with the [multipatch Tomb Raider Series XP/Vista Multi Patch]}
{nfo [2_0 Tomb Raider II 2.0]. This version needs 
[gototab_sound_WNMM.MCI MCI emulation] to get the CD music volume controls 
working }
{nfo a|downloadGold ^ This|a version of Tomb Raider II Gold. Also requires 
[gototab_sound_WNMM.MCI MCI emulation] to get cd music working }
{nfo i<Vanila>i Tomb Raider III Gold}
}

{b {f} ==[Failed to setup DirectX error]==
If you encounter this problem, hold shift when you start any of the games with 
this program to run their respective setups
}          
  
{b {f} ==[Low frame rate on TR2]==
If you encounter a bug that turns TR2 into a slide show after a while, 
a|SCRIPT1 ^ disable joysticks|a on the game, then use 
a|gototab_input_j2k.u ^ Xinput to keyboard emulation|a}
 
{b {f} ==[TR3 doesn't respond to input]==
Delete the config.txt file on the game folder. Next time the game starts, it will 
create that file again}

{b {f} ==[TR3 Gold crashes on the title screen]==
This happens on rysen CPUs. To fix it, copy the config.txt file from your TR3 
folder to the TR3 Gold folder and unplug your gamepad before you start the 
game||n
To play with a gamepad, you can use 
a|gototab_input_j2k.u ^ Xinput to keyboard emulation|a and
replug your controller after the game starts
} 

{b {i} ==[Widescreen]== The widescreen fix is calculated and applied automatically 
when you start the game. However, if you change the resolution while playing 
(F1-F2 on TR2), you will need to reset the widecreen fix. To do it, press tab 
and wait until you hear a|ON ^ this sound|a, then enter and leave the inventory}

{b {i} ==[Texture packs]==
a|_iOS ^ TR2 iOS version textures|a ||n
a| newdwight ^ TR3 2K upscale|a ||n
a|milepanic ^ TR3 4K AI upscale|a ||n
a|remaster ^ TR3 HD remaster|a - wip||n
a|jungle ^ TR3 jungle level textures|a ||n
 
Note that the default location for texture packs maybe changed since some of 
those packs have been released, so check the 
[gototab_graphics..._textswap.e texture swap options] to make sure
where to install them||n 
 
If you install the iOS textures, run TR2 setup, choose the
advanced tab and select: texel adjustment &#8594 always adjust 
}  
   
{b {i} ==[HQ FMVs]== 

Higher quality replacement FMVs can be created for both games. To replace a FMV,
paste a .mp4 or .bik file in the FMV 
folder alongside the original .rpl file it is meant to replace, but don't delete
the .rpl file. e.g.: to replace Ancient.rpl, paste a Ancient.mp4 or 
Ancient.bik file on the FMV folder||n

HQ FMVs have already been created for Tomb Raider II by others and 
can be downloaded from a|FMV_Remaster ^ here|a or a|mp4 ^ here|a ||n 

HQ FMVs require an 
additional download of [vlc these vlc binaries]. After downloading them, extract 
the -[vlc]- folder to -[peixoto\program]- >>n

HQ FMVs also work better with [gototab_...graphics_NEFS non-exclusive 
fullscreen]. Without it, the tasks bar shows for moment during transition to the FMVs.
If you encounter problems with the FMVs even with 
[gototab_...graphics_NEFS non-exclusive fullscreen] enabled,
[patreon let me know] so i can fix it

::0.10.16+::
<div class="alert-danger alert">
	==[Version warning]==
	Version [old_version_redirect 0.10.16] is the last one on which Tomb Raider 2 and 3 will be tested. Currently, they work fully in this version on both
	Windows and Linux, but future versions may break compatibility with these titles.
	With the excellent remasters, the effort of maintaining compatibility with this titles is a bit of a waste
