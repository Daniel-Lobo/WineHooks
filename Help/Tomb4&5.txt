{b {nfo} ==[Supported versions]==
This patch was tested with the the CD versions of the games patched with the 
[multipatch Tomb Raider Series XP\Vista Multi Patch]. Digital versions might
work as long as you install the 
[multipatch Tomb Raider Series XP\Vista Multi Patch] ||n

 On my computer, windows defender causes trouble with the MultiPatch PCtomb5.exe.
If your game fails to start, add that file to the windows defender exclusions 
list }

{b {f} ==[Failed to setup DirectX error]==
If you encounter this problem, hold shift when you start any of the games with 
this program to run their respective setups
}          
  
{b {f} ==[TR5 freezes after the eidos FMV]==  
if you encounter this bug, 
use the a|gototab_input_j2k.u ^ Xinput to keyboard emulation|a option
and then every time you play, unplug your gamepad before you start and plug 
it again at the title screen} 

{b {f} ==[Widescreen fix]==
The widescreen fix is calculated and applied automatically when you start the game. If you 
change the resolution while playing, you will need to reset the widescreen fix. To 
do it, press tab and wait until you hear a|ON ^ this sound|a, then enter and leave
the inventory}

{b {i} ==[HQ FMVs]== 

a|fish ^ GoldfishGam3r|a has created high quality remasters of the TR4 FMVs
which can be downloaded from a|HQFMV ^ here|a. ||n

HQ FMVs require an 
additional download of [vlc these vlc binaries]. After downloading them, extract 
the -[vlc]- folder to -[peixoto\program]- >>n

HQ FMVs also require [gototab_...graphics_NEFS non-exclusive 
fullscreen]. If you encounter problems with the FMVs even with 
[gototab_...graphics_NEFS non-exclusive fullscreen] enabled,
[patreon let me know] so i can fix it
