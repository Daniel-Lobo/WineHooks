{b {f} ==[Installing the Game on 64 bit windows]==
<ul>
l|Create a folder for the game, preferably in a non protected 
folder, let's say: b|  c:\Dark Earth|b 

l| Inside that folder, create one additional folder: 
b| c:\Dark Earth\Disk 2|b

and all the files from the disk 2 to b| c:\Dark Earth\Disk 2|b 

l|Copy b| i3comp.exe|b and b| InstallDarkEarth.bat|b from b|Peixoto\Patches\Dark Earth|b
to b| c:\Dark Earth|b and double click  b| InstallDarkEarth.bat|b 

l| Install the official patch (de_upd1.zip) that you can find in
b|Peixoto\Patches\Dark Earth|b 

l|You're ready to play the game using the program
</ul> }

{b {f} ==[Errors loading files]==
If you have a 32bit system, installed the game normally and you 
get errors complaining the a file could not be found, create a 
folder for each disk in the directory where you installed the game 
and copy all the files from each disk to those folders}
 
{b {nfo}  ==[Cheats]==             
You can press b<h>b to show\hide a list of 12 movements to beat the board game 
and the solution to the Tomb Puzzle - to hide these hints, after pressing b<h>b you
also need to change the room you are in}         

{b {bad}  ==[Bugs]==
The i|fading|i effect displayed when the player changes rooms
will not show. Note: actually, i belive this is caused by the official update }
