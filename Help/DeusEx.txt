l|Select the renderer of your choosing then restart the game using the patch. 
Change the resolution to %smallres%. The game will run at your desktop 
resolution, but the GUIs and HUDs will be almost as big as they would at 640x480

::Section::Important remarks::

l|With the OpenGl renderer on DeusEx, a lighting bug is triggered everytime you 
enter the display settings menu. Therefore, after you configure the resolution,
you will have to restart the game ||n

l|With the OpenGl and Direct3D 7 renderers, if any of the games crash, you will 
need to a|gammatool ^ reset your desktop gamma |a ||n

l|The OpenGl, Direct3D 7 and Direct3D 8 renderers are only available for unreal
gold after you install a|227i ^ patch 227i |a ||n

l|The Direct3D 7 renderer is listed simply as Direct3D and on Unreal Gold 
suffers from stuttering if texture swapping is enabled ||n
