::CPUTab::
::BOOL::singlecore::Single core affinity::
This will set the process affinity only to the logical CPU core of the highest 
index. Even if the game doesn't need this, the autohotkey interpreter sometimes does.
If your game sends you a series of message boxes complaining that it is out of
memory, enable this    

::BOOL::HRT::High resolution timers::
This can fix low or choppy frame rate on some games
::parent::HRT_details::
::HIDDEN::HRT_datailed::Details::Adapted from a|DDcompat ^ here|a, but with a 
safer approach that doesn't affect the entire system::

::parent::CPU_div::
::BOOL::QPCFix::QueryPerformanceCounter Fix::
Also fixes low or choppy frame rate on some games. If a game starts to show 
issues only after the computer has been running for a while, it probably need 
this. For some games it might be necessary to combine this feature and the one
above::
::parent::QPCFix_details::
::HIDDEN::QPCFix_datailed::Details::This hooks the QueryPerformanceCounter|n 
function and changes its behavior so it will|n report not the number of counts since|n 
windows had started, but since|n the current process was started::

::parent::CPU_div::
::BOOL::rnm::Disable shims::This clears compatibility flags set on the HKCM
registry secion that override flags set by the user and render the two options 
bellow inefective. GOG installers sometimes set these flags and this breaks their 
CD audio emulation, and therefore the music, in some games

<ul>
    <li><b>On windows</b>, this has the same effect as right clicking on the game's executable file
    and setting the <b> compatibility mode</b> on the <b> compatibility tab</b>, but a few additional modes are enumerated here
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>On linux</b>, this has not effect, however on
    <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Commands/winecfg" target="_blank">wine config's</a>
    <b>Applications tab</b>, you can change the windows version b|per application|b, without need to use a different prefix, and
    in some games you might need to mach the settings here wit the one on <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Commands/winecfg" target="_blank">winecfg</a>
