{b {nfo} ==[Important remarks]==
{nfo It's recommendable that you use patch 1.0c - for USA and EUR versions of 
the game - that you can find
[oldforum here] or [_newforum here], other versions will work
as long as not configured for software mode} 

{nfo If you want the FMVs to play at their original size centered on the screen, 
disable the [gototab_...graphics_GDI FMV fix] option}}
