The b| InstallShield|b tool allows you too install 
games using old InstallShield 16-bit installers on 64-bit systems||n

To use them, simply click on the Install button above and follow the instructions 
on screen ||n

You can inspect if a game uses a 16-bit InstallShield installer by left clicking
on the setup executable file and selecting i|properties|i. On the i|details|i tab 
you will find the i|Product name|i: InstallShield. Don't forget to check the 
i|Product version|i to select the corresponding tool||n

I haven't retro-engineered the InstallShield 16-bit installers, these tools are 
merely automatizing the method described a|shield ^ here|a, but also employing 
symbolic links - shortcuts - to avoid having to copy files arround, and also 
fixing some registry entries that may be set incorrectly because the installer
doesn't run directly from the CDRom ||n
