     {nfo} ==[[gototab_input_j2k.u Keyboard emulation with a Xinput Gamepad]]==
     Is usefull to configure shortcuts to save\load states
     since Kega-Fusion doesn't allow shortcuts to be mapped on a gamepad, or to
     be remapped at all. A full [gototab_input_j2k.u profile] is already 
     configured, but disabled
}      
{b
     {f} ==[Fast horizontal scrolling]==
     Can cause some unpleasant artifacts on Kega-Fusion. That can be fixed by 
     selecting -[Nearest multiple]- on the -[video]- menu. On a 1080p monitor,
     you'll only lose 72 vertical lines. 
     [gototab_input_j2k.u Keyboard emulation] can also cause this problem, but
     this can be avoided by always selecting the -[Keyboard Tap]- mode
